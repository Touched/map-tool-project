# map-tool-project

Tools for managing a mapping project

It is bundled with a tool (`import-rom-project`) that dumps the maps from a FireRed ROM to JSON using `@touched/gba-serialize`.

Usage: `import-rom-project rom.gba charmap.txt outputdir`

You can get a charmap from the `pokeruby` repository, as it follows the same structure.
